# the repo's old seed), and it was never installed over here anyway -- only
# backed up. The .deb payload used to ship a stale seed copy under this same
# path with no conffiles guard, so every package upgrade would have silently
# clobbered a live-tuned list; that seed file is now removed from the
# package entirely (same fix already applied to cams.json once before).
# Live backups of whatever's on disk still happen below, unconditionally.

# IMPLEMENTS xdog, and tina's device.env still says CV_EDGE_STYLE=xdog from
# when that value was inert. Deploying the module without also pinning the
# style would silently switch tina's renderer to XDoG on restart -- the one
# change we agreed not to make. So the style is pinned to overlay (its
# actual current behaviour) in the same operation.
